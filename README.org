** ~streaming-osm~

This library provides the ability to read and process [[http://www.openstreetmap.org/][OpenStreetMap]]
data via the [[https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming][streaming]] ecosystem. Since /streaming/
allows for very little RAM overhead despite file size, we can process very large OSM PBF files
just by providing a file path:

#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
import           Streaming
import           Streaming.Osm
import qualified Streaming.Prelude as S

-- | Count all nodes.
count :: IO ()
count = do
  len <- runResourceT . S.length_ . nodes . blocks $ blobs "yourfile.osm.pbf"
  print len
#+END_SRC
